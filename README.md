BitVector

The BitVector project represents a simple bit vector implementation in Java. It provides methods to set and reset bits at specified positions in the bit vector.
The implementation uses an ArrayList to store the bits, with each element in the ArrayList corresponding to a 64-bit block.

Usage:

* Enter 0 to terminate the program.
* Enter 1 to set a bit to 1 at a specified position.
* Enter 2 to reset a bit to 0 at a specified position.
